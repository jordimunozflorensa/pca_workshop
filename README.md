# PCA Workshop

This repository contains the materials and code that I prepared for a workshop on Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The workshop contains all the steps needed to perform a PCA with different examples, using the most useful grafic representations to visualize the obtained results. The project demonstrates how to perform PCA using Python and includes a detailed ppt presentation along with some CSV files used as datasets for practical examples.

## Overview
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a dimensionality reduction technique commonly used in data analysis and machine learning to reduce the complexity of high-dimensional datasets while preserving most of the variance in the data.

This repository includes:
- Python code to perform PCA on various datasets.
- CSV files containing the datasets used in the workshop.
- A PowerPoint presentation explaining the PCA concept and its applications.

## Files in the Repository
- `pca_workshop.py`: Python script that demonstrates how to perform PCA on the datasets.
- `presentation.pptx`: A PowerPoint presentation explaining the concept of PCA and its practical applications.
- `countries_data.csv`: Dataset used for the first example.
- `countries_data_categorical.csv`: Dataset used for categorical example.
- `countries_data_encoded.csv`: Dataset of categorical encoded variables example.
- `README.md`: Documentation of the repository.
  
## Running the Code
To run the Python code, you will need to have Python installed along with some libraries for data processing and visualization. Follow the steps below to set up the environment:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pca-workshop.git
    cd pca-workshop
    ```

2. Install the required Python libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
